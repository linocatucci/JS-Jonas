/*
-- let's build a fun quiz game in the console---

1. build a function constructor called question to desribe a question. A question should include:
a. question itself
b. the answer from which the player can choose the correct one (choose an adequate data structure here, array, object, etc.)
c. correct answer (i would use a number for this)

2. create a couple of questions using the constructor

3.store them all inside an array

4. select one random question and log it on the console, together with the possible answers (each question should have a number (hint: write a method for the question object for this task)).

5. use the ' prompt' function to ask the user fo the correct answer. The user should input the number of the correct answer such as you displayed on task 4.

6. check if the answer is correct and print to the console wether the answer is correct or not (hint: write another method for this)

7. suppose this code would be a plugin for other programmers to use in their code. So make sure that all your code is private and doesn't intefere with the other programmers code (hint: we learned a special technique to do exactly that IIFE, right?:)
